# Step1X 3D Server Files

This repository contains the 3D model files required by the Step1X 3D server. It includes both geometry and texture-related components necessary for 3D model processing and rendering.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

### 1. `step1x3d_geometry/`
Contains the geometry-related components for 3D models:
- `models/`: 3D model definitions and structures
- `systems/`: System-level implementations
- `utils/`: Utility functions for geometry processing

### 2. `step1x3d_texture/`
Contains the texture and rendering-related components:
- `models/`: Texture model definitions
- `renderer/`: Core rendering functionality
- `pipelines/`: Processing pipelines
- `loaders/`: Asset loading utilities
- `schedulers/`: Task scheduling components
- `custom_rasterizer/`: Custom rasterization implementations
- `differentiable_renderer/`: Differentiable rendering components
- `systems/`: System-level implementations
- `utils/`: Utility functions for texture processing

## Usage

These files are designed to be used with the Step1X 3D server. They provide the necessary components for:
- 3D model geometry processing
- Texture mapping and management
- Custom rendering pipelines
- Differentiable rendering capabilities

## Dependencies

This repository is part of a larger system and should be used in conjunction with the Step1X 3D server. Please refer to the main server documentation for specific setup and usage instructions.
